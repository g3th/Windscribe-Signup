# Windscribe Account Maker (Kali/Debian/Linux) #

## 10GB Account with Email Verification ##

### Completely automates the registration process, and creates 5 accounts ###

#### Important : It is likely current temporary email will be blocked by sysadmins. It will not be updated frequently. If you have a valid Temp-Email RapidApi api-key (Basic, free, no Â£ cost) to use let me know.

This account maker uses VPN Gate and Developer Email api in order to register for a free
Windscribe account. 

It will select a random VPN Gate server, connect with Network-Manager, and ping google to determine if the connection is valid. In the future Tracert might be added to determine speed and discard slow connections.

It will then launch the browser, generate user credentials (username, 10 digit alpha-numeric password and email), enter the credentials into the open automated-browser and take a screenshot of the browser.

The Pillow image library will crop the screenshot, leaving just the captcha box in order for Tesseract to work its magic (or get it wrong, mostly by one letter).

Finally the automation will enter the captcha, create the account, and fetch the verfication link.

The program works most times, however since Tesseract is involved, it does not have a 100% captcha-recognition rate.
